# Secure Password Generator

## Overview
Welcome folks to my first Python hands-on project : a **Secure Password Generator**! I did start small since this is a handy beginner-friendly Python script designed to help you folks create strong, secure passwords with ease. My passwords were freekin weak til' now and we all know they are a crucial part of keeping our online accounts safe. As matter of fact, this tool aims to simplify the process of generating them. Using Python's `secrets` module, this script ensures that the passwords generated are not just random but cryptographically secure—making them a great choice for any sensitive application.

## Features
- **Customizable Length**: You can easily specify the length of the password you want (default is set to 12 characters).
- **Built-in Strength Checks**: The script ensures that your password includes at least one special character and at least two digits, so you can feel confident that it’s strong enough.
- **Secure Randomness**: By leveraging the `secrets` library, the generated passwords are much more secure than those created with standard random methods.

## How to Use It
Getting started with the Secure Password Generator is pretty simple:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Veshka404/Secure-Password-Generator.git
   cd Secure-Password-Generator

2. **Run the script**:
python password_generator.py

3. **Enjoy your strong password!**:

By default, it will generate a password of length 12. 

If you guys want a different length, just tweak the pw_length parameter in the create_pw function.

## Example Output
When you run the script, you might see something like this:
aB3$kLm9#pQr

Well, pretty secure I guess :-)

## Lessons Learned 
It was my first hands-on project and even if I'm still learning I think it's important to get hands-on for mastering skills. 
As I said before : starting small !

The Importance of Security: I realized just how crucial it is to use cryptographic libraries for password generation. It adds a layer of security that makes a real difference and reduce scamming plot.
Working with Python Modules: I'm still a nub to this and I got to know how to handle with string modules a lot better and how to use them effectively in my code. I mean outpassed the "Hello world!" first snippets :-)
Password Strength: I learned how to implement checks for password strength in a way that ensures the passwords meet certain criteria.
