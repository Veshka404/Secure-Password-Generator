# Libraries: secrets provides a secure method for generating random values, which is better suited for security-sensitive applications than Pythonâ€™s standard random module. string gives access to sets of characters (ascii_letters, digits, punctuation).

# Character Sets: The password uses a mix of uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to enhance security.

# Password Strength Check: The while loop keeps generating new passwords until one includes at least one special character and two digits, ensuring the password is secure.

# Execution Check: The if __name__ == '__main__': block allows the function to be used both as a script and as an importable module.#
